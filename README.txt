MERCER HSK DATABASE

This project aims to provide a searchable, sortable database of chinese characters and their related pinyin and english translations.

Up until this point Cody and Jarrett have developed a database + web interface with the ability to pull information of varying types 
and display it in the form of an HTML + CSS table with the use of PHP and Mysql. The web interface currently only exists to display 
basic information about the group, the HSK terms and their related attributes, and the legal documents for this project. The project 
will soon receive an update including search functionality, more HSK level 1 terms, and further implementation of the frequency rank and radical columns.
